                    It's always hard choosing a place to eat around the area.
                    There are times where it takes over 30 minutes just thinking
                    of what to eat. For those indecisive folks, it would be nice
                    to have a generator to select random restaurants to eat. It
                    can also help give ideas by having the application choose
                    random restaurants for you. I feel like it is universal
                    because everyone has to eat. Time is important so donâ€™t
                    waste time thinking when you should be eating.
